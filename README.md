**ðŸ§®Calculation game!**

A fun little math game to test your mental calculation skills!
You can choose between:

âš¡ Speed Mode â€“ Solve as many problems as you can in the time limit

ðŸŽ¯ Classic Mode â€“ 10 questions, no time pressure

ðŸ“˜ Training Mode â€“ Focus on specific operations and practice

The problems include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division â€” all designed to make you think a bit (carry-over, borrowing, and so on). Great for quick brain training or just to beat your own high score!
